## The Iris Dataset (Notes to be written up)
### History and provenance
- Collection of botanical measurements taken on three species of iris flower
- Data taken by botanist Anderson, published 1936, https://doi.org/10.2307/2394164
- Versicolor and Setosa samples taken at same site at Gaspé Peninsula, Quebec, 1935.
- Unwin & Kleinman date the Virginica samples to 1926, Tenesssee
- Used by Fisher (1936) to demonstrate his method of statistical analysis

### Data description
- The dataset consists of measurements of 150 plants, 50 each of three species. Each plant has four measurements - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all in cm.

### Fame
- Considered the "hello world" of data sets, famously used as a sample or "toy" dataset, or test dataset, in the fields of data science, statistics, data visualisation, machine learning. Fisher's paper has been cited over 9000 times.
- Useful set of labelled data for testing classification methods
- Dataset is available as part of R base, scikit-learn, pandas

### Corruption
- The scikit-learn documentation indicates that the UCI version contains two incorrect data points that are inconsistent with the data in Fisher's paper. The UCI repository contains a corrected version named "bezdekiris.data", after Bezdek et. al. (1999) pointed out these two incorrect points.
